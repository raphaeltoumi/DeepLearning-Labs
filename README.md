# Deep Learning Labs

Solutions to the Deep Learning course laboratories at EURECOM.

This repository contains a series of experiments built using Python and TensorFlow with the purpose of exploring modern Deep Learning techniques.

In the [first](https://github.com/marioguerriero/deeplearning-labs/blob/master/Lab01-MNIST/Lab1_DL-Students_v3.ipynb) notebook I developed my own implementation of a neural network using bare Python and NumPy with goal of acquiring a deep understanding of how feedforward prediction and training works. 

In [Lab02](https://github.com/marioguerriero/deeplearning-labs/blob/master/Lab02-TensorFlow_MNIST/Lab2_DL-Students.ipynb) notebook, instead, I worked with TensorFlow for building a convolutional neural network capable of classifying the MNIST dataset. In particular, I implemented a LeNet-5 architecture and I obtained an accuracy of 99%.

Finally, in [Lab03](https://github.com/marioguerriero/deeplearning-labs/blob/master/Lab03-RNN/lab3_students.ipynb) I have developed a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network and a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) for performing Sentiment Analysis on user comments coming from several popular Internet services. At the end, I obtained a 87.5% accuracy level.
